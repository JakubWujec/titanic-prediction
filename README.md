### pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

### age 
Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

### sibsp
The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

### parch
The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.



# Decks
[text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_facilities_of_the_Titanic#location)
The bulk of First-Class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the Titanic, where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to First-Class recreation accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks.
